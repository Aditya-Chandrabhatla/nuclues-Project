# Codebase Explanation

This codebase is primarily for a web application named "Nucleus". It consists of multiple HTML pages, each serving a different purpose, and a global CSS file for styling.

## HTML Pages

1. **Nucleus.html**: This is the main page of the application. It includes a sidebar navigation menu with options like Home, Question Bank, Mock Exams, Performance, and Profile. The main content area is designed to display various subjects.

2. **MCQPage/mcq.html**: This page is designed to display multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for the user to answer.

3. **MCQPage/correctanswer.html** and **MCQPage/wronganswer.html**: These pages are displayed based on the user's answer to an MCQ. They provide an explanation for the correct answer.

4. **subjecttopics.html**: This page displays various topics under a particular subject. It includes a navigation bar with options like Course Content, Overview, Notes, Announcements, Reviews, and Learning Tools.

5. **accounts/forgotPassword.html**: This page provides a form for users who have forgotten their password and need to reset it.

## CSS Styling

The [global.css](file:///Users/adityachandrabhatla/Desktop/AI-Applications/nuclues-Project/global.css#1%2C1-1%2C1) file provides styling for the entire application. It includes styles for the sidebar navigation, main content area, buttons, dropdowns, and various other elements.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is used in the HTML pages to add interactivity. For example, in [Nucleus.html](file:///Users/adityachandrabhatla/Desktop/AI-Applications/nuclues-Project/Nucleus.html#1%2C1-1%2C1), a click event listener is added to the hamburger menu button to toggle the sidebar's visibility. In [subjecttopics.html](file:///Users/adityachandrabhatla/Desktop/AI-Applications/nuclues-Project/subjecttopics.html#1%2C1-1%2C1), click event listeners are added to the navigation buttons to display the corresponding content.

## File Paths

The file paths in the code snippets indicate where each file is located in the project directory. For example, [MCQPage/mcq.html](file:///Users/adityachandrabhatla/Desktop/AI-Applications/nuclues-Project/MCQPage/mcq.html#1%2C1-1%2C1) indicates that the [mcq.html](file:///Users/adityachandrabhatla/Desktop/AI-Applications/nuclues-Project/MCQPage/mcq.html#1%2C1-1%2C1) file is located in the `MCQPage` directory.

## Code Snippets

The code snippets provided are parts of the HTML and CSS files. They show how various elements are structured and styled. For example, the HTML snippets show how the sidebar navigation and main content area are structured, while the CSS snippets show how these elements are styled.

## Conclusion

This codebase is a well-structured and styled web application. It uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
